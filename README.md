## Steps to view in local 
`
Replace the file location of dog images in html file to render it. 
`

## Recommendations 
1. Always use percentage for image dimensions instead of giving pixels otherwise it will not adjust to screen size
2. Keep the font-size in percentage so that when rendered on new screen will auto adjust 
3. Width of any div, keep it even instead of 15% use 20%
